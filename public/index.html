          Native to South Africa, bird of paradise is a low-maintenance
          perennial plant with a tropical vibe. It thrives in well-lit indoor
          areas—near a window is best—and needs to be watered once a week (or
          when the soil gets dry).

        <p>
          Peperomia obtusifolia (AKA baby rubber plant) is known for its sturdy
          spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Florida, this houseplant has
          succulent-like qualities, meaning it stores water in its roots, stems,
          and leaves. This desk-sized option from The Sill comes in a five-inch
          round ceramic pot and only needs to be watered every week or two.

          The waxy, green-leafed Zanzibar gem (ZZ plant for short) is the
          perfect mid-sized houseplant. It helps purify the air, doesn't mind
          low-light conditions, and only needs water once every few weeks. The
          Sill's medium ZZ comes in a 7-inch round ceramic planter in black,
          blush, cream, mint, or classic terracotta.

        <p>
          Native to West Africa, fiddle leaf figs need a little more attention
          than other plants. They prefer warmer temps, do best in rooms with
          bright natural light, and require frequent watering to keep the soil
          moist at all times.

          week and set it in a brightly lit room.

          watered about once a week. This hardy plant from The Home Depot comes
          in a hanging basket with a removable hook. Hang it from your wall,

        <p>
          Snake plants are natural air-purifiers, helping to filter the air you
          breathe while oxygenating your space.1 Plus, they don't need very much
          water or light, which is ideal for houseplants. This elegant
          pre-potted pick from Pure Beauty Farms comes in a 9-inch round pot and
          will be about 3 feet tall when it arrives at your home.

        <p>
          The aspidistra elatior (often called the cast-iron plant or bar-room
          plant) is an almost indestructible low-maintenance option. It can
          thrive in heavily shaded areas and requires very little watering—in
          other words, it's OK if you neglect it a little. This cast-iron plant
          comes in a 6-inch container and sits about 3 feet tall

        <p>
          Tropical spathiphyllum plants (also known as peace lilies or sweet
          Pablos) can produce white flowers—even indoors. They tolerate
          low-light conditions but don't mind brightly lit areas either. And
          you'll know when to water it, as the leaves will begin to droop. This
          sweet Pablo is about 4 feet tall and ships straight to your door from
          Costa Farms.
